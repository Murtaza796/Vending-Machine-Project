# Vending-Machine-Project
A working project of how a vending machine works.
In order to execute this project:
 the "gpaycodetest.py" is the maim file which is supposed to be executed first, where we create our port on where the web browser is hosted, then it generates a qr code by itseld, and stores it to the "qrcodes" folder as an image, it also opens a webcam automatically on its own
 then, we take a picture of the scanner and show it to the webcam, which will scan and take you directly to the website,
 we can purchase our items and make payment on the same page.
